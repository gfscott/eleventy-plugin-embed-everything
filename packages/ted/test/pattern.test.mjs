     * In testing, you have to reset the RegExp object's lastIndex 
     * property. This is because when you use the /g flag for
     * global matches, the regular expression instance keeps track
     * of where the previous match was found, then continues searching
     * from that point. It resets to zero if the index value is more
     * than the length of the input.
     * 
     * In this testing case, where we loop through a set of examples,
     * the index is set to the length of the test string on its first
     * match, but the second match fails because the search starts
     * either partway through the string or the index is greater than
     * the string length. In that case, the index is reset to zero
     * and the third match succeeds.
     * 
     * This took a *long* time to debug. The solution is to reset
     * the RegExp object's lastIndex value to zero before the
     * test runs on the next loop.
