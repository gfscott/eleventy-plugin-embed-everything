Adds support for embedding Instagram Reels and TV videos alongside existing photo/post support.

- Adds comprehensive test cases for Reels and TV URLs, covering various formats (with/without protocol, www, trailing slash, whitespace, etc.).

This expands the plugin's functionality to cover all major Instagram content types while maintaining backward compatibility and using the existing Instagram embed script (no new dependencies).
